# Advent of Code 2024, in JavaScript with the help of AI
This time in JavaScript with the help of AI ([Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/))

## Description
Every year I take a stab at Advent of Code, each year I try something new so it's not only fun but also a learning experience.

Since I skipped 2023 because life was too busy - this year I decided to go for a langauge I'm familiar with. I still wanted to try something new and since AI is all the rage - I decided to use an AI assistant while doing the challenges.

I'll be documenting my learnings in this README.md file and also in random skeets on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/mazur.today) or Mastodon [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@mazur).

## Findings

### Pre-work
- Since I've been away from coding for a while - it was nice to have suggestions on project structure and tools to use. 
- Most of the suggestions I got were wrong, or just dumb. For example using Jest instead of the built in testing framework or using async to wait for syncronous reads.
- Refactoring my code to a generator automatically was nice, but it didn't do a great job as it started to change things. I spent a lot of time fixing AI misstakes.
- AI is really bad at git!
- Lastly, when suggesting authors it just started adding in random names of other people.
- Today I went from intigued to worried.
- I'm not sure AI saved me any time today - probably would have been quicker without it.

### Day 02
- Working with AI can be stressful and confusing - it just adds code that I need to spend figuring out.
- It does give some clever solutions to specific problems. Like using Math.sign to check the direction of the change.
- It's helpful in refactoring simple code like tests in bulk.
- Overall, I'm slightly frustrated. Still would have been quicker to do it manually; we are both learning.
- I find it tough to trust the AI. It actually suggested a correct solution for Part 2; but I wanted to be more clever. I ended up reverting my clever solution and went with the AI suggested one.
